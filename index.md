## Overview
This workshop is meant to be a platform of exchange between the three communities of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. We want encourage them to find feasible solutions that bridge the gap between stand-alone  perception and robotic related tasks such as motion or assembly planning, visual servoing  and grasping. A main topic is how sensing, manipulation and planning  can be combined to yield mutual benefits. We also search for scalable  learning-based approaches that require little supervision and examine them on their benefits and limitations. This can include learning in simulation, transfer and few-shot learning, automatic labeling or reinforcement learning. Are end-to-end learning  approaches really the right way to go or are modular pipelines still preferable due to better introspection? Are current subtask metrics suitable indicators for execution success? What is necessary to address the  needs of end-user applications in terms of scalability, robustness, runtime, cost,  maintainability and fail-safety?

## Call for Papers
We solicit __2-4 page extended abstracts__ (following RSS style guidelines). The submissions can include: __late-breaking results__, __under review material__, or __archived__. We strongly encourage the preparation of __live demos__ or __videos__ accompanying the submission.

* Reducing the setup time through automatized training procedures
  * What do we gain / sacrifice with the current methods that require less supervision?
  * Transfer learning, learning in simulation, automatic labeling, reinforcement learning
* How can the interaction between sensing, manipulation and planning yield mutual benefits?
  * e.g. Extracting semantic information from visual/tactile data for improved execution planning
* Scalable approaches for grasping novel objects and for generalizing functional grasps
* As end-to-end approaches gain traction, which benefits and limitations do they possess compared to modular pipelines?
  * How can we achieve introspection in end-to-end methods?
  * Are commonly used subtask metrics in modular approaches suitable indicators for execution success?
* Which possibilities for automatic recovery exist to create failure proof systems?
* Addressing the needs of end-user applications in terms of robustness, runtime, cost, maintainability, etc.

Submitted papers will be reviewed by the organizers and invited reviewers. Accepted contributions will be presented as posters or within the Demo/Video Talk format. Selected papers are further featured as spotlight talks. All accepted contributions and posters will be posted on the workshop website upon author approval
