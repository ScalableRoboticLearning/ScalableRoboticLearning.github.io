## TENTATIVE TOPICS

* Reducing the setup time through automatized training procedures
  * What do we gain / sacrifice with the current methods that require less supervision?
  * Transfer learning, learning in simulation, automatic labeling, reinforcement learning
* How can the interaction between sensing, manipulation and planning yield mutual benefits?
  * e.g. Extracting semantic information from visual/tactile data for improved execution planning
* Scalable approaches for grasping novel objects and for generalizing functional grasps
* As end-to-end approaches gain traction, which benefits and limitations do they possess compared to modular pipelines?
  * How can we achieve introspection in end-to-end methods?
  * Are commonly used subtask metrics in modular approaches suitable indicators for execution success?
* Which possibilities for automatic recovery exist to create failure proof systems?
* Addressing the needs of end-user applications in terms of robustness, runtime, cost, maintainability, etc.
